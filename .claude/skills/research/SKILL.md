description: Strategic research workflow for executive leaders managing multiple domains (funding, PX/HR, finance, board, sales/marketing, compliance). Structured approach to gather evidence, synthesize insights, and inform decisions across organizational functions.
---

# Executive Research Mode

Make decisions with **evidence**, not assumptions.

```
Define scope → Gather sources → Analyze → Synthesize → Recommend → Document
```

## When to Use

**Trigger signals** (if you're about to do any of these, use this skill instead):
- "I need to understand best practices for..."
- "What are other organizations doing about..."
- "Help me prepare for a board presentation on..."
- "I need data to support a decision on..."
- "What are the risks/opportunities around..."

**Use for:**
- Strategic decision support (funding, M&A, partnerships)
- Policy development (HR, compliance, governance)
- Market intelligence (competitors, trends, positioning)
- Board preparation (reports, due diligence, benchmarks)
- Regulatory/compliance research
- Cross-functional initiative planning

## Arguments

```
/research [topic] [optional: domain focus]
```

Domain focuses: `funding` | `govt-funding` | `hr` | `finance` | `board` | `sales` | `marketing` | `compliance` | `strategy` | `operations`

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Define the Research Question (2 min)

**Clarify scope with SMART criteria:**

| Element | Question | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Specific** | What exactly do we need to know? | "What compensation benchmarks exist for senior engineers in NZ?" |
| **Measurable** | How will we know we've answered it? | "3-5 salary ranges from credible sources" |
| **Actionable** | What decision will this inform? | "Setting FY26 salary bands" |
| **Relevant** | Which domain(s) does this impact? | "HR, Finance, Board approval" |
| **Time-bound** | When is this needed? | "Before Q2 board meeting" |

**Output:**
```
Research Question: [Clear, specific question]
Decision Context: [What this will inform]
Stakeholders: [Who needs this information]
Domains Affected: [HR, Finance, Board, etc.]
Success Criteria: [What "done" looks like]
```

──────────

### Phase 2: Source Identification (3 min)

**Identify credible sources by domain:**

| Domain | Primary Sources | Secondary Sources |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Private Funding** | Investor reports, pitch decks, term sheets, cap tables | Industry benchmarks, similar raises |
| **Govt Funding** | Grant portals, RFP documents, agency guidelines, past awards | Success case studies, funder reports, policy announcements |
| **HR/PX** | HRIS data, engagement surveys, exit interviews | Industry salary guides, Glassdoor, LinkedIn |
| **Finance** | Financial statements, budgets, forecasts | Industry ratios, analyst reports |
| **Board** | Board packs, minutes, governance frameworks | Best practice guides, peer company filings |
| **Sales** | CRM data, pipeline reports, win/loss analysis | Market research, competitor intel |
| **Marketing** | Campaign analytics, brand tracking, market research | Industry reports, competitor analysis |
| **Compliance** | Regulations, audit reports, policy documents | Legal opinions, industry guidance |

**Source quality hierarchy:**
1. **Primary data** - Your own organizational data
2. **Peer-reviewed/Official** - Government, academic, regulatory
3. **Industry reports** - Reputable analysts (Gartner, McKinsey, Deloitte)
4. **Trade publications** - Industry-specific media
5. **General media** - Major publications (verify with other sources)

**Output:**
```
Sources Identified:
- Primary: [Internal data sources]
- External: [Reports, databases, publications]
- Experts: [People to consult]
- Gaps: [Information we can't easily access]
```

──────────

### Phase 3: Evidence Gathering (5-10 min)

**Systematic collection:**

For each source, capture:
```
Source: [Name/URL]
Type: [Primary/Secondary/Tertiary]
Date: [Publication date]
Key Finding: [1-2 sentence summary]
Relevance: [High/Medium/Low]
Credibility: [High/Medium/Low]
```

**Cross-functional considerations:**

| If researching... | Also check impact on... |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Private Funding | Finance (cash flow), Board (governance), HR (equity plans) |
| Govt Funding | Compliance (reporting obligations), Finance (matching funds, cash flow timing), Operations (deliverables), HR (funded positions) |
| HR Policy | Finance (costs), Compliance (legal), Operations (implementation) |
| New Market Entry | Sales (pipeline), Marketing (positioning), Finance (investment), Compliance (regulations) |
| Cost Reduction | HR (headcount), Operations (capability), Board (strategy alignment) |
| Compliance Change | All domains - map specific impacts |

**Output:**
```
Evidence Summary:
- [Finding 1]: Source, credibility, relevance
- [Finding 2]: Source, credibility, relevance
- [Finding 3]: Source, credibility, relevance

Conflicting Information:
- [Area]: Source A says X, Source B says Y

Gaps Remaining:
- [What we still don't know]
```

### Phase 4: Analysis Framework (5 min)

**Select appropriate framework(s):**

| Framework | Best For | Structure |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **SWOT** | Strategic positioning | Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats |

| **Porter's Five Forces** | Competitive analysis | Rivalry, Buyers, Suppliers, New Entrants, Substitutes |
| **Risk Matrix** | Risk assessment | Likelihood x Impact grid |
| **Decision Matrix** | Option comparison | Weighted criteria scoring |
| **Stakeholder Map** | Change management | Power x Interest grid |
| **Financial Analysis** | Investment decisions | NPV, ROI, Payback, IRR |

**Executive-specific considerations:**

```
Strategic Alignment:
- Does this align with our mission/vision?
- How does this fit our 3-year strategy?

```

**Output:**
```
Analysis:

```

──────────

### Phase 5: Synthesis & Recommendations (5 min)

**Synthesize across domains:**

```
Cross-Domain Impact Assessment:

| Marketing | [H/M/L] | [Specific action] | CMO |
| Compliance | [H/M/L] | [Specific action] | Legal |
| Operations | [H/M/L] | [Specific action] | COO |
```

**Formulate recommendations:**

Each recommendation should include:
- **What**: Clear action statement
- **Why**: Evidence-based rationale
- **Who**: Responsible party
- **When**: Timeline/urgency
- **How**: High-level approach
- **Trade-offs**: What we're choosing not to do

**Confidence levels:**
- **High confidence**: Strong evidence, multiple sources agree

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER recommend without evidence** - Every recommendation needs supporting data
2. **NEVER present single-source findings as fact** - Triangulate important claims
3. **NEVER ignore cross-domain impacts** - Executive decisions ripple across the org
4. **ALWAYS state confidence levels** - Be explicit about uncertainty
5. **ALWAYS consider the board perspective** - Will this withstand governance scrutiny?
6. **ALWAYS document sources** - Decisions may be questioned later

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Research question is SMART
- [ ] Multiple credible sources consulted
- [ ] Cross-domain impacts assessed
- [ ] Appropriate framework applied
- [ ] Recommendations are evidence-based
- [ ] Confidence levels stated
- [ ] Executive summary is board-ready
- [ ] Sources documented for audit trail

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Confirmation bias | Actively seek contradicting evidence |
| Single source reliance | Require 2+ sources for key claims |
| Analysis paralysis | Set time limits, accept "good enough" |
| Domain silos | Always check cross-functional impact |
| Recency bias | Include historical context |
| Over-confidence | State assumptions and limitations |
