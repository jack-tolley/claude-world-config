## Executive Summary

Lamb meatballs are a versatile, flavor-rich dish with strong Mediterranean, Greek, and Moroccan influences. The key to success is using 80-85% lean ground lamb, minimal mixing, and complementary herbs/spices (mint, cumin, oregano). They can be pan-fried, baked, broiled, or grilled.

---

## Key Findings

1. **Fat content matters** - 80/20 ground lamb is optimal; leaner blends produce dry, crumbly meatballs.
2. **Binders prevent dryness** - Panko breadcrumbs + egg + Greek yogurt keep meatballs tender and moist.
3. **Don't overwork the meat** - Light handling produces tender meatballs; overworking makes them dense.
4. **Chilling helps** - Refrigerating shaped meatballs for 30-60 min helps them hold their shape during cooking.
5. **All cooking methods work** - Baking at 400°F for ~15 min, broiling for ~5 min, or pan-frying 3 min per side all produce excellent results.
