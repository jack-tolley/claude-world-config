# Claude World Configuration

My personal Claude Code configuration for the `claude-world` project workspace.

## Contents

- **`.claude/commands/`** - Custom slash commands for common workflows
- **`.claude/skills/`** - Reusable skills (debug, research, closedown)
- **`.claude/scripts/`** - Utility scripts
- **`.claude/README.md`** - Documentation

## Usage

Copy the `.claude` directory into your project root to use these configurations.

Note: `settings.local.json` is gitignored as it contains project-specific permissions.
